Layout of project 


app.js used as main navigation 


apps folder - > screens , for each "screen"/page of the app 


apps folder - > assets -> subfolders for each asset type 


packageinstallstuff.txt has required packages with install commands for the project 

Note : Layout does not scroll up with keyboard anymore becuase of "softwareKeyboardLayoutMode": "pan" added to app.json , this solves layout breaking but could be a future issue
